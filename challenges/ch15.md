# Solution to Challenges 

### Challenge #1
```
Keeping operator precedence in mind, what bytecode instruction sequences would you generate for the following expressions:

a. 1 * 2 + 3
b. 1 + 2 * 3
c. 3 - 2 - 1
d. 1 + 2 * 3 - 4 / -5

(Remember that Lox does not have a syntax for negative number literals, so the -5 is negating the number 5.)
```
### Solution #1 

a. `1 * 2 + 3`
```c++
CONST 1
CONST 2
MULTIPLY
CONST 3
ADD
```
b. `1 + 2 * 3` 
```c++
CONST 1
CONST 2
CONST 3
MULTIPLY
ADD
``` 
c. `3 - 2 - 1`
```c++
CONST 3
CONST 2
SUBTRACT
CONST 1
SUBTRACT
``` 
d. `1 + 2 * 3 - 4 / -5`

```c++
CONST 1
CONST 2
CONST 3
MULTIPLY
ADD
CONST 4
CONST 5
NEGATE
DIVIDE
SUBTRACT
``` 
### Challenge #2
```
If we really wanted a minimal instruction set, we could eliminate either OP_NEGATE or OP_SUBTRACT. 
Show the bytecode instruction sequence you would generate for: 

4 - 3 * -2

First, without using OP_NEGATE. Then, without using OP_SUBTRACT.
Given the above, do you think it makes sense to have both instructions? Why or why not? 
Are there any other redundant instructions you would consider including?
```
### Solution #2 

Without `OP_NEGATE`- `4 - 3 * (0 - 2)`
```c++
CONST 4
CONST 3
CONST 0 
CONST 2
SUBTRACT // 0 - 2 would push -2 onto the stack  
MULTIPLY
SUBTRACT
```
Without `OP_SUBTRACT` - `4 + (-3) * (-2)`
```c++
CONST 4 
CONST 3 
CONST 2 
NEGATE 
MULTIPLY 
NEGATE // very similar to how subtraction is done on a lower level
ADD
``` 
Does it make sense to have both instructions? For our purposes, I would say yes. Our opcode set is quite compact and minimizing it isn't an issue we are concerned with. 
I also find that keeping the instructions separate allows for a better understanding of the intentions of the user from a developer's POV as well. It makes it easier 
to reason about the codebase and identify the purpose of the two opcodes (at least from my experience). 

### Challenge #3 
```
Our VM’s stack has a fixed size, and we don’t check if pushing a value overflows it. 
This means the wrong series of instructions could cause our interpreter to crash or go into
undefined behavior. Avoid that by dynamically growing the stack as needed.
What are the costs and benefits of doing so?
```

### Solution #3
The solution is similar to the `lines` and `code` dynamic arrays created for the chunk struct. 
```c++
typedef struct {
	Chunk* chunk;
	uint8_t* ip; // points to the next instruction, not the one currently being handled
	Value* stack;
	int stackCapacity;
	int stackCount; // points to where the NEXT value should go
	
} VM;
```

Exchanging the static stack for one allocated dynamically does sacrifice on implementation simplicity (I'd have to search more 
on the performance sacrifices if any). Having a dynamic stack ensures that the stack's size is only increased if processing the user's 
source code demands it to be. Having a static stack size may also lead to a wastage in memory in the scenario that the user's source code 
does not require exactly 256 bytes to be allocated. The flip side would be a demand for more stack space as the current static size is inadequate - 
leading to failure to continue processing. A dynamic stack size solves both of these issues.

### Challenge #4 

```
To interpret OP_NEGATE, we pop the operand, negate the value, and then push the result. 
That’s a simple implementation, but it increments and decrements stackTop unnecessarily, since the 
stack ends up the same height in the end. It might be faster to simply negate the value in place 
on the stack and leave stackTop alone. Try that and see if you can measure a performance
difference. Are there other instructions where you can do a similar optimization?
``` 
 
### Solution #4 

We test the execution times for both of the methods by simply calling the `testStack()` function which outputs the time elapsed to execute the given piece of code.
```c
case OP_NEGATE: {
	testStack(true);
	testStack(false);
	break;
}
```
If the boolean is `true`, the function outputs the execution time for the original method, and if not, the second method is ran (not modifying `stackTop`/`stackCount`)
```c
static void testStack(bool boolean) {
	
	struct timespec begin;
	timespec_get(&begin, TIME_UTC);

	if (boolean) { push(-pop()); } 
	else { vm.stack[vm.stackCount - 1] = -vm.stack[vm.stackCount - 1]; }

	struct timespec end;
	timespec_get(&end, TIME_UTC);

	double time_spent = (end.tv_nsec - begin.tv_nsec);
	printf("RESULT: %f\n", time_spent);
}
```
Although the result is an approximate, it was found that, for maority of the time, the second method resulted in a faster execution speed.
