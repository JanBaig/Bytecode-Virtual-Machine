# Solution to Challenges

### Challenge #1 
```
We could reduce our binary operators even further than we did here. Which other instructions can you eliminate, 
and how would the compiler cope with their absence?
```

### Solution #1 

### Challenge #2
```
Conversely, we can improve the speed of our bytecode VM by adding more specific instructions that correspond 
to higher-level operations. What instructions would you define to speed up the kind of user code we added support 
for in this chapter?
```

### Solution #2
