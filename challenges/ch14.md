# Solution to Challenges

### Challenge #1
```
Given that the current encoding of line information is wasteful of memory, devise an encoding that compresses the line information 
for a series of instructions on the same line. Change writeChunk() to write this compressed form, and implement a getLine()
function that, given the index of an instruction, determines the line where the instruction occurs.
```
### Solution #1
Our previous implementation of line information consisted of storing a separate array of integers, `lines` that parallels the bytecode. 
Each number in the `lines` array is the line number for the corresponding byte in the bytecode. When a runtime error occurs, we look up
the line number at the same index as the current instructionâ€™s offset in the bytecode array.

For example, the line information for the bytecode, `OP_RETURN`, at index 5 in the bytecode array could be found by simply looking
up `lines[5]`. 

To increase the efficiency of memory, a new imeplementation consists of storing line information into a dynamic 2D array.
Each element in the 2D array is a subarray that holds two pieces of information - the number of bytes (index 0) that correspond to the
line number (index 1). An example element could be `[5, 2]` which means that 5 bytes were emited from the second line of the source code.
This is far more efficient than our prior implementation that would correspond to 5 entries of `2` into the `lines` array `[..2, 2, 2, 2, 2, ...]`

Initializing the new line fields in `initChunk()`
```c++
chunk->lines = NULL;
chunk->linesCapacity = 0;
chunk->linesCount = 0;
```

The `writeChunk()` method is updated to add a new entry into the dynamic 2D array whenever a new line numnber is encountered. 
```c++
// New Line into 2D Line Array
chunk->lines[chunk->linesCount] = NULL;
chunk->lines[chunk->linesCount] = GROW_ARRAY(int, chunk->lines[chunk->linesCount], 0, 2);
chunk->lines[chunk->linesCount][0] = 1;
chunk->lines[chunk->linesCount][1] = line; 
chunk->linesCount++;
```
In `writeChunk()`, For a line that already exists, the 0th index of the element that holds the inforamtion for that line is updated. For example, 
that would be mean that the 5 in `[5, 2]` would be updated to `[6, 2]`.
```c++
chunk->lines[chunk->linesCount-1][0]++;
```
Finally, a new `getLine()` function is implemented that gets the line information from the new 2D array given the index of the byte in the byetecode 
sequence.

```c++
int getLine(Chunk* chunk, int byteIndex) {
	for (int i = 0; i < chunk->linesCount; i++) {
		if (byteIndex < chunk->lines[i][0]) { return chunk->lines[i][1]; }
	}
	return 0;
} 
```
All the new updates for this challenge can be found in the `./CLOX/chunk/chunk.c` file 

### Challenge #2 
```
many instruction sets feature multiple instructions that perform the same operation but with operands of different sizes. 
Leave our existing one-byte OP_CONSTANT instruction alone, and define a second OP_CONSTANT_LONG instruction. It stores the operand
as a 24-bit number, which should be plenty.
```
