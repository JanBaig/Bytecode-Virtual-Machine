# Solution to Challenges 

### Challenge #1
```
What token types would you define to implement a scanner for string interpolation? 

What tokens would you emit for:
"Nested ${"interpolation?! Are you ${"mad?!"}"}"

Consider looking at other language implementations that support interpolation to see 
how they handle it.
```
### Solution #1 

From how munificent's language `Wren` parses it: 

```c++
TOKEN_INTERPOLATION "Nested " // everything before the '${' symbols
TOKEN_INTERPOLATION "interpolation?! Are you "
TOKEN_STIRNG "mad?!" 
TOKEN_STIRNG "" // end of inner string interpolation
TOKEN_STIRNG "" // end of outer string interpolation
```

### Challenge #2 
```
Several languages use angle brackets for generics and also have a >> right shift operator. 
This led to a classic problem in early versions of C++: 

vector<vector<string>> nestedVectors; 

Later versions of C++ are smarter and can handle the above code. Java and C# never had 
the problem. How do those languages specify and implement this?

```

### Solution #2

Will come back to this.

### Challenge #3 
```
Name a few contextual keywords from other languages, and the context where they are meaningful.
What are the pros and cons of having contextual keywords? How would you implement them in your languageâ€™s front end if you needed to?
```

### Solution #3 

Will come back to this.
