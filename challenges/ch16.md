# Solution to Challenges 

### Challenge #1
```
What token types would you define to implement a scanner for string interpolation? What sequence of tokens would you emit for the above string literal?

What tokens would you emit for:
"Nested ${"interpolation?! Are you ${"mad?!"}"}"

Consider looking at other language implementations that support interpolation to see how they handle it.
```
### Solution #1 

Two tokens - `STRING`, `DELIM_STRING` 
`DELIM_STRING` needs to be handled differently.  
STRING_START, STRING_EXPR, STIRNG_END 

### Challenge #2 
```
Several languages use angle brackets for generics and also have a >> right shift operator. This led to a classic problem in early versions of C++: 

vector<vector<string>> nestedVectors;

Later versions of C++ are smarter and can handle the above code. Java and C# never had the problem. How do those languages specify and implement this?

```

### Solution #2

### Challenge #3 
```
Name a few contextual keywords from other languages, and the context where they are meaningful. What are the pros and cons of having contextual keywords? How would you implement them in your languageâ€™s front end if you needed to?
```
