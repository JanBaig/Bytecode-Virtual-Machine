NOTES

- Source Program -> (Compiler) -> ByteCode -> (Interpreted) -> VM/Emulator -> Machine Code
- Learned about conditional preprocessing
- int* pointer, var1 [defining a pointer that holds addresses of variables of type Int]
  var1 = 10 
  pointer = &var1 [var1 is of type Int and therefore, pointer stores it's address]
- Going to have an array of instructions and each instruciton has an opcode (operation code)
