LOGIC

2 + 3
(2)(+)3 
currently stopped at the '+' and calls the mainParse functionns on the 3
after the parsing is done from the 3 onwards, execution is returned to the binary function 
binary function now has both of its arguments fully evaluated (bytecodes emmited)
now it can push its own OP_ADD bytecode
