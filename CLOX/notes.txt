NOTES

Main 
-> VM 
	-> Interpret()	// init a chunk, start the compilation process and store the compiled bytecode into the chunk along with its constants
		->  Compile()  
			-> init scanner 
			-> recursion with pratt parsing  

LOGIC

2 + 3
(2)(+)3 
currently stopped at the '+' and calls the mainParse functionns on the 3
after the parsing is done from the 3 onwards, execution is returned to the binary function 
binary function now has both of its arguments fully evaluated (bytecodes emmited)
now it can push its own OP_ADD bytecode

- Arg2Res

// Print the 2D array First
	for (int i = 0; i < chunk->linesCount; i++) {
		printf("(Count: %d, Line %d)\n", chunk->lines[i][0], chunk->lines[i][1]);
}

For challenge #1, mention that its called run-length encoding to be percise
