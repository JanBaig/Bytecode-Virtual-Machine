# Bytecode-Virtual-Machine

A Bytecode Virtual Machine (VM) written in `C`. To avoid the overhead of traversing an AST, a bytecode representation is introduced. The `scanner` outputs tokens which are later given as input to the `compiler` to genrate bytecode - similar to assembly code although magnitudes simpler with a limited set of instructions. The generated bytecode is later given as input to the `VM` that then executes and displays the output.
