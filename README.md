# Bytecode-Virtual-Machine

A Bytecode Virtual Machine (VM) written in `C`. To avoid the overhead of traversing an AST, a bytecode representation is introduced. The `scanner` outputs tokens which are later given as input to the `compiler` to generate bytecode - similar to assembly code although magnitudes simpler with a limited set of instructions. The generated bytecode is later given as input to the `VM` that then executes and displays the output.

## Potential Improvements to Solutions

- [ ] (Chp15/#4) - Look into ways to more accurately measure performance. How is the memory/CPU affected? 
- [ ] (Chp16/#1) - Understand how [Wren](https://github.com/wren-lang/wren/tree/8fae8e4f1e490888e2cc9b2ea6b8e0d0ff9dd60f) and other languages interpret string interpolations. Maybe add support for it later on.
